## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge event that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, and participants can solve them in any programming language of their choice.

For more information, visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## How to Use This Repository

Each day's solution is contained within its own directory, named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number. Inside each directory, you will find the following files:

- `part1.rs` - Solution for Part 1 of the day's challenge.
- `part2.rs` - Solution for Part 2 of the day's challenge.
- `input.txt` - The input data for the day's challenge.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, navigate to the respective day's directory and copy the content of the solution to the main.rs.
